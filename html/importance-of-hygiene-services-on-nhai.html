            IMPORTANCE OF HYGIENE SERVICES ON NHAI.
          </h2>
          <br />
          
          <p>
            A nation's healthy and growing economy is dependent on
            The National highways of India, but what about its level of
            hygiene? National Highway which has emerged as a
            dominant segment of the economy is critical to India's
            growth story. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It accounts for more than 3.6 percent of
            India's GDP, or roughly two-thirds of all
            transport-related contributions to the
            country's GDP. With a total length of 5.5
            million kilometers, India has one of the
            world's largest road networks.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            But the most critical factor that if put into account cannot
            be ignored is HYGIENE. People in large amount travel
            across the National Highways therefore they are bound to
            use the services provided on the National Highways. But
            the question is are those services really neat and hygienic
            to prefer?
          <br />
          <p>
            Although, the Government of India has launched several
            projects to develop the National highways and road
            networks but what about the hygiene level of the road and
            on the roadside on the National Highways? 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            National Highways, the lifeline of the country, is yet lacking
            neat, sanitized, and clean washrooms and restrooms
            facilities. That forces people or travelers to get hygienic
            food and refreshment across the roadside on the National
            Highways. This problem is a major issue in our country. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          
          <h2 class="mainHeading classCenter">Importance Of Hygiene And Sanitation On
            National Highways.</h2>
          <br />
          <img src="image/hygiene1.png" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>
            Hygiene and sanitation are important on National Highways
            for a variety of reasons, including personal, social,
            psychological, and health concerns. Proper hygiene and
            sanitation help to prevent diseases and infections.
            Diseases will be greatly reduced if every Highway in our
            country practices good hygiene measures to maintain a
            healthy ecosystem and better transportation. 
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Another critical factor is sanitation. Many of the common
            diseases mentioned earlier, such as roundworms, spread
            through the air in the surroundings and infect people. As
            we are aware that the roadside amenities are usually
            crowded which increases the risk of infections. We can
            completely eliminate such diseases, by ensuring proper
            sanitization in public places so that people do not get
            infected in public. By identifying diseases and infectious
            symptoms accordingly can be prevented through proper
            sanitization.

          <h2 class="mainHeading classCenter">Need Of Development Of Hygienic Roadside
            Amenities For Truckers </h2>
          <br />
          <img src="image/hygien2.png" alt="" /><br />

          <p>
            Over the past years, there has been a significant increase
            in heavy vehicles such as Trucks, and trailers, on the Road
            networks. Accidents have increased due to the lack of
            efficient services on the National Highways. As a result,
            there is an urgent need for the development of hygienic
            amenities on the Highways to avoid accidents and improve
            road riding qualities. With the main focus on providing
            hygienic services and strengthening the National
            Highways, as well as improving the driving experience. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The provision of adequate roadside amenities is critical not
            only for improving road safety but also for reducing fatigue
            caused by travel. RIYO is intended to provide safe
            stopping points equipped with necessary amenities at
            regular intervals along the highways for truckers during their
            journey in order to reduce driving-related fatigue and make
            the journey more pleasant.  
          </p>

          <p>
            RIYO is in the process of developing a policy on

            with required amenities such as eateries, restrooms,
            and truck stops.  
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            During the journey, safe drinking water, clean toilets,
            parking space, rest room, and so on are provided to
            reduce driving-related fatigue and improve the driver's
            overall travel experience.

          <h2 class="mainHeading classCenter">Summing Up</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Truckers play a critical role in maintaining the economy of
            our country. They help in the transportation of life-saving
            medicine, equipment, and supplies. Also play a crucial role
            in the transport of essential goods to supermarkets,
            pharmacies, hospitals, and other critical services to various
            sectors within the country. Thus, it is important that the
            Highways must have better and clean amenities to offer
            hygienic services to truckers all over the country to maintain
            their healthy lifestyle on the Highways. 
            RIYO is working closely to help the National Highways with
            this challenging task by providing the best hygienic

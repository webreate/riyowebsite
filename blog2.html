            <h2>GET THE BEST TRUCK DRIVING JOBS IN INDIA WITH RIYO</h2>
            <p>A country of nearly 140 crore people, 28 states ,8 union territories and an area of 3.287 million
                KM².Having 151019 KM National Highways from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Gujrat and Arunachal Pradesh with
                Different cultures, ethnicity and religion in order to Sustain this huge lively hood a massive network
                of Road, Ports, Industries and Manufacturing units Has been established in past 75 years and is
                Continuously growing throughout India. For this purpose, the product has to be moved from its origin to
                the beneficiary by Rail, Port, Air and Road. <br><br>


                The life of a Truck Driver is challenging. Working as a long-haul truck driver is a way of life because
                these drivers can be away from home for days or weeks at a time. In comparison to those modern vehicles
                showing their supremacy and glamor on the Highways of India. A truck driver lives a life far from it.
                <br><br>


                According to a study done by Save Life Foundation.org. 53% of drivers make INR 10,000 to INR 20,000 per
                month. With fewer Truck Driving Jobs, their living conditions are disturbing, with no smart income, no
                social protection, and no incentives to complete a trip on schedule. Long distances, though, remain
                vulnerable due to the transportation industry's informal structure. According to the findings of this
                study, more than half of truck drivers are unsatisfied with their jobs. 84% of those polled indicated
                they would not recommend trucking to family members or relatives. Due to the absence of protection and
                safety on the road, two-thirds of drivers find the occupation unappealing. <br><br>


                They frequently suffer from driver fatigue as a result responsible for lengthy working hours. Every
                heavy truck driver spends approximately 11.9 hours each day driving. A truck driver travels
                approximately 417 kilometres-+ each day on average. 49% of respondents claimed they drive even when they
                are tired or sleepy. <br><br>


                “According to the report,75% of the drivers surveyed complained about harassment by police and local
                groups;72% spoke about low and irregular income; and nearly 36%felt there is no dignity of their labour.
                While the trucking industry plays an integral role in driving the growth of India, the stressful and
                demanding nature of the work done by the truck drivers impacts their physical and mental well-being.
                Over 50% of Indian truck drivers face driving-related health issues, per a study conducted by Kantar
                IMRB in association with Castrol India. <br><br>

                The month-long research study, covering over 1,000 truckers, was carried out to understand the health
                issues faced by truck drivers of the country. Truck drivers have a high rate of occupation-related
                injury and have among the highest rates of on-job fatality, yet, for 63% of the truck drivers, health
                does not feature amongst their top three priorities in life, as per the survey.”</p>

            LIFE OF AN INDIAN TRUCK DRIVER
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            More Than 300 Years Ago, A Horse-Drawn Wagon Was Used To Carry Goods
            From One Place To Another, Which Took Months To Reach Its
            Destination. The Same Trip Today Is Completed In A Maximum Of 6 Days
            By Big Wheels With Trucks Carrying More Goods Than The Horse-Drawn
            Wagon. As Our Capacity To Move Goods Has Grown, So Has Demand.
            Almost Everything You See, Touch, And Use Today Was Moved By A Truck
            Driver At Some Time In Its Life. It's No Wonder That Many Truck
            Drivers Love The Phrase, "If You Bought It, A Truck Carried It." No
            One Knows The Truth Of That Phrase Better Than The Hardworking Men
            And Women Who Are Now Driving A Truck.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="mainHeading classCenter">
            Life Of An Indian Truck Driver
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Life Of An Indian Truck Driver Is Not Easy. A Career As A Truck
            Driver Is Very Different From A Career Where You Work In An Office
            From 9 To 5. Out On The Road As A Truck Driver, You Work For Longer
            Hours, And Your Road Becomes Your Home. A Home Away From Home,
            Family And Friends. Such A Lifestyle Becomes Boring And Lonely.
            However, You Can Visit Places And Enjoy Adventures On The Roads. But
            According To Studies By The Times Of India, More Than 53% Of Truck
            Drivers Find Their Jobs Dissatisfying. You Know That Truck Drivers
            Are Essential, But What Is It Like To Be One? A Typical Trucker Can
            Travel 500 Miles Daily Because Most People Work 70 Hours A Week For
            An Eight-Day Workweek, Equating To Nearly 128,000 Miles Per Year.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>
            Let’s Dig Deep Into The Problems Faced By An Indian Truck Driver On
            A Daily Schedule Basis:
          </h3>
          <br />
          <img src="image/truck.png" alt="" /><br />
          <h4>A Typical Morning:</h4>
          <p>
            Truck Drivers Generally Wake Up In Their Truck Cabins With No
            Availability Of Basic Resources Of Washroom And Shower Facilities.
            Thus, They Have To Manage Either Before Getting On The Roads Or
            Taking A Stop At Their Respective Operating Centres Or When They
            Decide To Refill Their Fuel Tank.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>A Typical Afternoon</h4>
          <p>
            After 6-7 Hours Of Driving, They Take A 30-Minute Break In The Midst
            Of The Day. The Department Of Transportation Requires It For The
            Sake Of Safety. It's Critical For Them To Get Out Of The Vehicle,
            Stretch, And Eat A Light Lunch Or Snack To Remain Fresh And Ready
            For The Second Portion Of Their Driving Day.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>A Typical Evening</h4>
          <p>
            Indian Truck Drivers Often Face Challenges In Finding A Place To
            Park. They Even Had To Carry Their Own Food. They Cook Their Food By
            Themselves And Had To Sleep In Their Truck Cabins. Resulting In Lack
            Of Sleep And Body Aches.

            The life of a Truck Driver is challenging. Working as a long-haul
            truck driver is a way of life because these drivers can be away from
            home for days or weeks at a time. In comparison to those modern
            vehicles showing their supremacy and glamor on the Highways of
            India. A truck driver lives a life far from it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            According to a study done by Save Life Foundation.org. 53% of
            drivers make INR 10,000 to INR 20,000 per month. With fewer Truck
            Driving Jobs, their living conditions are disturbing, with no smart
            income, no social protection, and no incentives to complete a trip
            on schedule. Long distances, though, remain vulnerable due to the
            transportation industry's informal structure. According to the
            findings of this study, more than half of truck drivers are
            unsatisfied with their jobs. 84% of those polled indicated they
            would not recommend trucking to family members or relatives. Due to
            the absence of protection and safety on the road, two-thirds of
            drivers find the occupation unappealing.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            They frequently suffer from driver fatigue as a result responsible
            for lengthy working hours. Every heavy truck driver spends
            approximately 11.9 hours each day driving. A truck driver travels
            approximately 417 kilometres-+ each day on average. 49% of
            respondents claimed they drive even when they are tired or sleepy.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            “According to the report,75% of the drivers surveyed complained
            about harassment by police and local groups;72% spoke about low and
            irregular income; and nearly 36%felt there is no dignity of their
            labour. While the trucking industry plays an integral role in
            driving the growth of India, the stressful and demanding nature of
            the work done by the truck drivers impacts their physical and mental
            well-being. Over 50% of Indian truck drivers face driving-related
            health issues, per a study conducted by Kantar IMRB in association
            with Castrol India.

            The month-long research study, covering over 1,000 truckers, was
            carried out to understand the health issues faced by truck drivers
            of the country. Truck drivers have a high rate of occupation-related
            injury and have among the highest rates of on-job fatality, yet, for
            63% of the truck drivers, health does not feature amongst their top
            three priorities in life, as per the survey.”

            In India, over 8 million truck drivers sitting behind a steering
            wheel on a truck, driving across, and transporting goods along the
            second largest road network of the world is not just a job. It's a
            lifestyle, a lifestyle that no one appreciates or desires.
            Approximately 25% to 30% of India's trucks lie idle at any given
            point in time, and those employed in the sector are overworked. Our
            initiative is to provide dignity to local truck drivers with smart
            incomes and services. Join us for a better Highway system.

            <h2>IMPORTANCE OF HYGIENE SERVICES ON NHAI.</h2>
            <p>A nation's healthy and growing economy is dependent on The National highways of India, but what about its
                level of hygiene? National Highway which has emerged as a dominant segment of the economy is critical to
                India's growth story. <br><br>

                It accounts for more than 3.6 percent of India's GDP, or roughly two-thirds of all transport-related
                contributions to the country's GDP. With a total length of 5.5 million kilometers, India has one of the
                world's largest road networks. <br><br>

                But the most critical factor that if put into account cannot be ignored is HYGIENE. People in large
                amount travel across the National Highways therefore they are bound to use the services provided on the
                National Highways. But the question is are those services really neat and hygienic to prefer?
                Although, the Government of India has launched several projects to develop the National highways and
                road networks but what about the hygiene level of the road and on the roadside on the National Highways?
                <br><br>

                National Highways, the lifeline of the country, is yet lacking neat, sanitized, and clean washrooms and
                restrooms facilities. That forces people or travelers to get hygienic food and refreshment across the
                roadside on the National Highways. This problem is a major issue in our country.</p>
            <h2>Importance Of Hygiene And Sanitation On National Highways.</h2>
            <img src="image/hygiene1.png" alt="">
            <p>Hygiene and sanitation are important on National Highways for a variety of reasons, including personal,
                social, psychological, and health concerns. Proper hygiene and sanitation help to prevent diseases and
                infections. Diseases will be greatly reduced if every Highway in our country practices good hygiene
                measures to maintain a healthy ecosystem and better transportation. <br><br>


                Another critical factor is sanitation. Many of the common diseases mentioned earlier, such as
                roundworms, spread through the air in the surroundings and infect people. As we are aware that the
                roadside amenities are usually crowded which increases the risk of infections. We can completely
                eliminate such diseases, by ensuring proper sanitization in public places so that people do not get
                infected in public. By identifying diseases and infectious symptoms accordingly can be prevented through
                proper sanitization.</p>
            <h2>Need Of Development Of Hygienic Roadside Amenities For Truckers</h2>
            <p>Over the past years, there has been a significant increase in heavy vehicles such as Trucks, and
                trailers, on the Road networks. Accidents have increased due to the lack of efficient services on the
                National Highways. As a result, there is an urgent need for the development of hygienic amenities on the
                Highways to avoid accidents and improve road riding qualities. With the main focus on providing hygienic
                services and strengthening the National Highways, as well as improving the driving experience. <br><br>


                The provision of adequate roadside amenities is critical not only for improving road safety but also for
                reducing fatigue caused by travel. RIYO is intended to provide safe stopping points equipped with
                necessary amenities at regular intervals along the highways for truckers during their journey in order
                to reduce driving-related fatigue and make the journey more pleasant.</p>

                restrooms, and truck stops. <br><br>


                During the journey, safe drinking water, clean toilets, parking space, rest room, and so on are provided

                    <h2>Summing Up
                    </h2>
                    <p>Truckers play a critical role in maintaining the economy of our country. They help in the transportation of life-saving medicine, equipment, and supplies. Also play a crucial role in the transport of essential goods to supermarkets, pharmacies, hospitals, and other critical services to various sectors within the country. Thus, it is important that the Highways must have better and clean amenities to offer hygienic services to truckers all over the country to maintain their healthy lifestyle on the Highways. RIYO is working closely to help the National Highways with this challenging task by providing the best hygienic services on the National Highways to ensure all the Truckers get hygienic services in a safe and healthy environment throughout their journey.</p>

            <h2>HOW TRUCK DRIVER SHORTAGE EFFECT THE ECONOMY.</h2>
            <p><span>Indian Truck drivers</span> play a major role in maintaining the economy of our country. Trucks
                transport the most economically important commodities. Although these commodities are high on the list
                of market failures as weak trucking conditions carry the burden associated with their movement is
                justified from an economical perspective. Truck transportation has profound impacts on the social and
                economical well being of India. For example, on some of the major expressways, trucks can account for as
                much as 40% of total traffic on the National Highways. While it is true that package pick-up and
                delivery activities by Trucks are one of the leading causes of urban delays. There appears to be a huge
                gap between the transport of goods and the consumption of necessities such as commercial goods,
                services, and energy. The same can be said for economic contributions such as the nations economic
                growth. The focus of policy discussions on truck transportation in urban areas is almost always entirely
                on how to manage the negative impacts of truck activities through restrictions on their movement and
                access. A long-standing ban on daytime truck delivery in India is one such example.</p>
            <h2>Truck Driver Shortage</h2>
            <img src="image/shortage1.png" alt="">
            <p>Throughout the last decade, the trucking industry has faced a huge driver shortage. The driver shortage
                affects the entire economy because highways transport over 68% of all goods in India. And, as the cause
                that raises driver shortage, it has the potential to have a significant impact on the supplier costs
                and, as a result, It can also cause shipping delays and store shortages impacting our economy.
                The demographic of the current workforce, particularly age and gender, is one of the most significant
                factors influencing the driver shortage. The trucking industry is heavily reliant on male employees.
                With an alarming number of the drivers who are set to retire in 10-20 years, we are on the verge of a
                dangerous cliff. A cliff that, if fallen off, will have a significant impact on the industry if new,
                younger workers are not hired.</p>
            <h2>Poor Conditions And Low Pay Of Truck Drivers Results In Huge Driver Crisis</h2>
            <img src="image/shortage2.png" alt="">
            <p><span>"Truck drivers are safety devices, " "If the Trucks are running behind, you cant just keep the
                    trucker idle. If they are not being paid, you cannot back them up for hours. "</span> <br><br>


                Indian Truck drivers are classified and compensated in such a way that they have to wait until they are
                needed to shipping companies. As a result, there is little incentive given to them to use them for
                driving. For now, truckers continue to be misclassified. Truck drivers are paid by the load they carry,
                not by the hour, making them some of the most vulnerable workers of the country. they aren’t even
                considered as employees and don’t get any of the benefits or protections associated with that status
                that in itself is a major downfall for the truck drivers. <br><br>


                "Truck driving is a fairly difficult profession. It's extremely stressful on the body. It requires
                people to be away from their families and awake at extremely odd hours. it becomes lonely for them .
                "However, those who took part did so because there was a wage premium or did not have any choice. This
                has become increasingly a result of economic liberalization."</p>
            <h2>Lifestyle Of A Truck Driver</h2>
            <img src="image/shortage3.png" alt="">
            <p>The lifestyle of a truck driver is the next important topic to discuss. This lifestyle is unsuitable for
                many people, and it discourages them from even considering a career as a truck driver. Most new drivers
                are assigned routes that keep them on the road for extended periods of time, returning home only a few
                times per month. It can be difficult to adjust to living in a truck and showering at rest stops.
                Being on the road nonstop also limits the driver's diet options. Nobody can eat fast food and gas
                station snacks without suffering some health consequences. Not to mention, combine that kind of eating
                with a truck driver's healthy life, and the weight will pile on. This highcalorie, high-sugar diet can
                lead to serious health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure, and digestive problems.
                Drivers frequently skip sleep breaks in order to get their freight to its destination as soon as
                possible. This not only physically but also mentally affects the driver. Side effects such as mental
                fogginess, poor judgement, and forgetfulness can all make drivers more prone to accidents.</p>
            <h4>How RIYO Solves The Truck Driver Shortage</h4>
            <img src="image/shortage4.png" alt="">
            <p>Due to the challenges regarding the Truck Driver shortage, The following are some responses and potential
                policy solutions that RIYO initiates to solve the driver shortage:</p>
            <h4>Smart income to Truck Drivers</h4>

            <p>As we are seeing when there is a shortage of truck drivers, RIYO initiative is to raise the wages of its
                truck drivers with offering raises in addition to comprehensive benefits packages and various other
                options for its drivers.</p>



            <h4>Reduce drivers Time on the Road</h4>

            <p>Spending more time at home and less time on the road can help relieve many of the "lifestyle" issues.
                Reduce the average length of haul and keep our truckers more localized.</p>



            <h4>Lower Regulated Driving Age</h4>

            <p>The 18-20-year-old age group has the highest unemployment rate of any age group. RIYO, hires the
                commercial and deserved truck driver's with minimum age to help a large pool of competent workers by
                hiring them through filling open positions.</p>



            <h4>Independent Trucking</h4>

            <p>With the advanced technology that independent trucking brings, as well as the benefits of reducing daily
                driving stress and boredom, RIYO is bound to attract young, tech-savvy drivers.</p>



            <h4>Giving Less Truckload Shipping</h4>

            <p>The majority of the driver shortage occurs on the road (OTR) and full-truckload (FTL) shipping methods,
                as these methods require a lot of time on the road and that hard truck driver lifestyle. So that the
                drivers, on the other hand, return home each evening.</p>
                <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
                <p>It is a matter of great concern that the truck drivers who play a major role in maintaing the economy of our country are considered as a minority and are neglected by the society. Therefore, RIYO,s initiative by helping the truck drivers by providing value and dignity to their profession so that, the driver on the wheels feel proud for their profession and continue to contribute and boost the economy of our country. With RIYO, it is possible.</p>

            <h2>TRUCK DRIVERS AND INDIAN HIGHWAY</h2>
            <p>Indian Truck drivers are prone to major Truck accidents on National Highways. According to a study done
                by the National crime record bureau (NCRB) concerning the state and region, Indian Highway has reported
                most of the road accidents (81,410 out of 4,03,116 cases) from 18:00 hrs to 21":00 hrs (Night),
                accounting for 20.2% of total road accidents. From 18:00 hrs to 21:00 hrs (Night), the majority of road
                accidents were reported in Tamil Nadu (14,415 cases ), Madhya Pradesh (9,798 cases), and Kerala (6,765
                cases ). The period '15:00 hrs to 18:00 (Day) and noon hrs to 15:00 hrs (day) accounted for 17.8%(71,711
                cases) and 15.5% (62,587 cases) of total road accidents during 2021. As per road classification, the
                National Highways, which has a share of only 2.1% of total road length (1.33 Lakh KMs out of 63.9 Lakh
                KMs), accounted for the highest road accidents, contributing 30.3% of total road accidents. State
                Highways having a share of 2.9% (1.87 Lakh KMs) of total road length, have reported 23.9% of road
                accidents in the country. <br><br>


                However, many road accidents were also reported on other roads. These accounted for 45.8% of total such
                accidents in 2021. State/UT-wise patterns revealed that maximum fatalities in road accidents on the
                National Highways took place in Uttar Pradesh (13.5%) (7,212 out of 53,615 deaths) followed by Tamil
                Nadu (10.0) (5,360 deaths), Maharashtra (7.5%) (3,653 deaths) and Andra Pradesh (6.7% (3,602 deaths
                during 2021. During 2021, two-wheelers have accounted for the maximum fatal road accidents (69,240
                deaths), contributing 4.5% of total road accidental deaths, followed by cars (23,531 deaths) (15.1%) and
                truck/ lorries (14,622 deaths) (9.4). <br><br>


                Driver error is ten times more likely to be the cause of a trucking accident than any other factor,
                according to survey results. No truck driver wants to get involved in a Road accident. An accident can
                cause them and others to be injured, cause damage to their truck and other property, cause legal and
                insurance issues, and keep them off the road for an extended period. Large trucks are any medium or
                heavy truck with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds, excluding buses and motor
                homes. Both commercial and non-commercial vehicles are included in this category. <br><br>
                A large number of deaths due to trucks/lorries/mini truck accidents (3,423 out of 14,622) were reported
                in Madhya Pradesh, accounting for 23.4%. 28.9% (1,337 out of 4,622) and 11.9% (551 out of 4,622) of
                fatal road accidents due to buses were reported in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, respectively. Deaths of
                14.8% (2,796 out of 18,936) of pedestrians in road accidents were reported in Bihar in 2021. The
                month-wise distribution of 'Road Accidents' shows that most road accidents were reported in January
                40,235 cases), contributing 10.0% of total road accidents. The majority of accidents this month
                (January) have been reported in Tamil Nadu, accounting for 13.2% of total accidents reported (5,322 out
                of 40,235 cases) in January.</p>
            <h4>According to the study, the following four critical aspects resulted in more truck accidents:</h4>
            <h4>Nonperformance</h4>
            <p>The driver fell asleep, was rendered immobile by a heart attack or seizure, or was otherwise physically
                impaired.</p>
            <h4>Recognition</h4>
            <p>The driver was inattentive, distracted by something inside or outside the vehicle, or failed to observe
                the
                situation adequately.</p>
            <h4>Decision</h4>
            <p>The driver needed to drive faster for the conditions, misjudged other vehicles' speeds, or followed other
                vehicles too closely. <br><br>

                The driver panicked, overcompensated, or displayed poor directional control. Since driver error is the
                leading cause of truck accidents, more focus should be placed on driver training behind the wheels.
                Aside
                from the increasing frequency of truck accidents, several other key factors also highlight the cause of
                Highway accidents.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Failure Of Equipment</h2>
            <img src="image/failure.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A driver is only as good as the truck they are driving. A mechanical failure could quickly result in a
                devastating accident. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's Fatal Causation Study,
                at least one mechanical failure occurred in 55 percent of truck accidents involving injury. The same
                study discovered that 30% of trucks had at least one piece of out-of-service equipment.</p>
            <h4>According to the study, the following four critical aspects resulted in more truck accidents:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Brakes that are defective or poorly maintained.</li>
                <li>Tires that are defected or worn</li>
                <li>Underride rails, for example, are either defective or missing.</li>
                <li>Lights that are not working properly or are defective, including turn signals.</li>
                <li>Overall, poor upkeep.</li>
                <li>Unbalanced cargo.</li>
                <li>Transmission breakdown.</li>
                <li>Manufacturing flaws in a component.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Speeding</h2>
            <img src="image/speed.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Speeding is the second-leading factor of car accidents, representing only distracted driving. Because of their sheer size and weight, semi-trucks can exert more force on whatever they collide with than cars. Truck drivers must be even more aware of their speed and the distance between other vehicles. Safety is more important than time, no matter how important it is to reach the destination timely. Maintaining an appropriate speed limit will not only increase road safety but will also help reduce fuel costs.</p>
            <h2>WRAPPING UP</h2>
            <p>The bottom line is that fatal truck accidents are terrifying. But they can be avoided by driving as safely as possible and ensuring that you have proper training and communication with your trucking company before youhit the road. RIYO will do everything possible to ensure your safety on the road. It is up to you to deal with conditions out of control. Always make responsible decisions to ensure a safe journey to your destination.</p>

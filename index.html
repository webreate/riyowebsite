    <h1>INDIA ON A JOURNEY</h1>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800" data-aos-duration="700">
      India! A country on a journey to become the world leader in
      Manufacturing and export. Currently, at 3 trillion US dollars, India’s
      GDP is estimated to become 3rd largest in the world by the end of this
      decade. For a country to progress and uplift itself as a society, its
      Logistics infrastructure has to be developed in such a way that its
      unwanted expense of both time and wealth are minimised hence optimising
      its output. India’s logistics infrastructure comprises of three major
      ways of transport
    </p>
    <ol data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800" data-aos-duration="700">
      <li>The Roadways</li>
      <li>The Waterways</li>
      <li>The Airways</li>
    </ol>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800" data-aos-duration="700">
      all three have come a long way in recent years, but there is still a
      long way to go to reach the level of developed countries. the future of
      India's logistics infrastructure looks promising, with the government
      and private sector working together to improve the sector's performance.
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800" data-aos-duration="700">
      A major challenge facing India's logistics infrastructure is a lack of
      standardisatio . The country's logistics sector is highly fragmented,
      with many small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the space.
      This lack of standardisation makes it difficult to coordinate logistics
      activities and results in inefficiencies in the supply chain. Another
      challenge to the country’s logistic industry is the lack of coordination
      between different players in the supply chain. The country's logistics
      sector is highly fragmented, and there is a lack of communication and
      cooperation between differentactors. This makes it difficult to manage
      logistics activities and results in inefficiencies in the supply chain.
    </p>
    <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800" data-aos-duration="700">ROADWAYS OF INDIA.</h3>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800" data-aos-duration="700">
      Roadways play a crucial role in a country's development as they are the
      backbone of a country's transportation system. They provide the means
      for people and goods to move around, which is essential for economic
      growth and development .roadways are an essential component of a
      country's infrastructure and play a vital role in its development. A
      well-developed road network can help to improve connectivity, economic
      growth, social development, tourism and regional development The Indian
      government's plans for reforming the logistics industry aim to create a
      more efficient and cost-effective logistics ecosystem in the country.
      The focus is on improving infrastructure, reducing costs, and making
      logistics more transparent and efficient. These initiatives will help to
      attract investment, create jobs, and ultimately drive economic growth.

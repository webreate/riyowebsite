            TRUCK DRIVERS AND INDIAN HIGHWAY
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Indian Truck drivers are prone to major Truck accidents on National
            Highways. According to a study done by the National crime record
            bureau (NCRB) concerning the state and region, Indian Highway has
            reported most of the road accidents (81,410 out of 4,03,116 cases)
            from 18:00 hrs to 21":00 hrs (Night), accounting for 20.2% of total
            road accidents. From 18:00 hrs to 21:00 hrs (Night), the majority of
            road accidents were reported in Tamil Nadu (14,415 cases ), Madhya
            Pradesh (9,798 cases), and Kerala (6,765 cases ). The period '15:00
            hrs to 18:00 (Day) and noon hrs to 15:00 hrs (day) accounted for
            17.8%(71,711 cases) and 15.5% (62,587 cases) of total road accidents
            during 2021. As per road classification, the National Highways,
            which has a share of only 2.1% of total road length (1.33 Lakh KMs
            out of 63.9 Lakh KMs), accounted for the highest road accidents,
            contributing 30.3% of total road accidents. State Highways having a
            share of 2.9% (1.87 Lakh KMs) of total road length, have reported
            23.9% of road accidents in the country.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            However, many road accidents were also reported on other roads.
            These accounted for 45.8% of total such accidents in 2021.
            State/UT-wise patterns revealed that maximum fatalities in road
            accidents on the National Highways took place in Uttar Pradesh
            (13.5%) (7,212 out of 53,615 deaths) followed by Tamil Nadu (10.0)
            (5,360 deaths), Maharashtra (7.5%) (3,653 deaths) and Andra Pradesh
            (6.7% (3,602 deaths during 2021. During 2021, two-wheelers have
            accounted for the maximum fatal road accidents (69,240 deaths),
            contributing 4.5% of total road accidental deaths, followed by cars
            (23,531 deaths) (15.1%) and truck/ lorries (14,622 deaths) (9.4).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Driver error is ten times more likely to be the cause of a trucking
            accident than any other factor, according to survey results. No
            truck driver wants to get involved in a Road accident. An accident
            can cause them and others to be injured, cause damage to their truck
            and other property, cause legal and insurance issues, and keep them
            off the road for an extended period. Large trucks are any medium or
            heavy truck with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000
            pounds, excluding buses and motor homes. Both commercial and
            non-commercial vehicles are included in this category.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            A large number of deaths due to trucks/lorries/mini truck accidents
            (3,423 out of 14,622) were reported in Madhya Pradesh, accounting
            for 23.4%. 28.9% (1,337 out of 4,622) and 11.9% (551 out of 4,622)
            of fatal road accidents due to buses were reported in Uttar Pradesh
            and Tamil Nadu, respectively. Deaths of 14.8% (2,796 out of 18,936)
            of pedestrians in road accidents were reported in Bihar in 2021. The
            month-wise distribution of 'Road Accidents' shows that most road
            accidents were reported in January 40,235 cases), contributing 10.0%
            of total road accidents. The majority of accidents this month
            (January) have been reported in Tamil Nadu, accounting for 13.2% of
            total accidents reported (5,322 out of 40,235 cases) in January.

          <h3>
            According to the study, the following four critical aspects resulted
            in more truck accidents:
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Nonperformance</h4>
          <p>
            The driver fell asleep, was rendered immobile by a heart attack or
            seizure, or was otherwise physically impaired.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Recognition</h4>
          <p>
            The driver was inattentive, distracted by something inside or
            outside the vehicle, or failed to observe the situation adequately.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Decision</h4>
          <p>
            The driver needed to drive faster for the conditions, misjudged
            other vehicles' speeds, or followed other vehicles too closely.
          </p>
          <p>
            The driver panicked, overcompensated, or displayed poor directional
            control. Since driver error is the leading cause of truck accidents,
            more focus should be placed on driver training behind the wheels.
            Aside from the increasing frequency of truck accidents, several
            other key factors also highlight the cause of Highway accidents.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h2 style="color: #0d61d3">Failure Of Equipment</h2>
          <br />
          <img src="image/failure.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            A driver is only as good as the truck they are driving. A mechanical
            failure could quickly result in a devastating accident. According to
            the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's Fatal Causation Study,
            at least one mechanical failure occurred in 55 percent of truck
            accidents involving injury. The same study discovered that 30% of
            trucks had at least one piece of out-of-service equipment.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>
            According to the study, the following four critical aspects resulted
            in more truck accidents:
          </h3>
          <br />
          <ul id="ul">
            <li>Brakes that are defective or poorly maintained</li>
            <li>Tires that are defected or worn</li>
            <li>
              Underride rails, for example, are either defective or missing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lights that are not working properly or are defective, including
              turn signals.
            </li>
            <li>Overall, poor upkeep</li>
            <li>Unbalanced cargo</li>
            <li>Transmission breakdown</li>
            <li>Manufacturing flaws in a component</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h2 style="color: #0d61d3">Speeding</h2>
          <br />
          <img src="image/speed.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Speeding is the second-leading factor of car accidents, representing
            only distracted driving. Because of their sheer size and weight,
            semi-trucks can exert more force on whatever they collide with than
            cars. Truck drivers must be even more aware of their speed and the
            distance between other vehicles. Safety is more important than time,
            no matter how important it is to reach the destination timely.
            Maintaining an appropriate speed limit will not only increase road
            safety but will also help reduce fuel costs.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="mainHeading classCenter">WRAPPING UP</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The bottom line is that fatal truck accidents are terrifying. But
            they can be avoided by driving as safely as possible and ensuring
            that you have proper training and communication with your trucking
            company before youhit the road. RIYO will do everything possible to
            ensure your safety on the road. It is up to you to deal with

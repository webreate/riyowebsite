            <h2>WHAT IS RIYO? HOW IT CAN\SOLVE THE CAUSE</h2>
            <p>India's Transport Sector Is Large And Diverse. It Caters To The Needs Of Billions Of People In India.
                Road Transportation Is A Major Contributor To The Indian Economy. The Sector Contributes About 5.5
                Percent To The Nation's GDP Alone. The Recent Launch Of India’s Logistics Policy Determines The
                Capabilities Of Transportation Sectors, But Still, There Is A Major Gap In Simplifying The Logistics
                Services On National Highways. <br><br>


                To Create An Ecosystem For All Logistics Service Providers Under One Roof And Work For The Betterment Of
                The Logistics Sector On Indian Highways, The Revolutionary Idea Of RIYO Was Born. RIYO Seamlessly
                Integrate Technology Into The Highway Network To Resolve All Sorts Of Highway And Logistics Problem To
                Help This Sector On Indian Highways.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">To Understand How RIYO Works, You Need To Understand What Are The Challenges
                That India’s Logistic Sector Deals With:</h2>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">India’s Logistics Sector</h2>
            <p>Today, In India, The Logistics Sector Accounts For Approximately 10% Of The Industry. With Their Current
                Contribution To The Industry, Logistics Companies Assist With Product Storage, Packaging, And Timely
                Delivery Right To The Customer's Door. Despite The Accomplishments, There Are Still Several Stumbling
                Blocks And Obstacles That Indian Logistics Companies Face.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Problems Faced By Logistics Companies In India:
            </h2>
            <p>dian Highway Is A Very Complicated And Vast Network Where Logistics Companies Face Lots Of Problems Like:
            </p>
            <h4>Lack Of Skilled Labour</h4>

            <p>Logistics Companies Face A Severe Shortage Of Skilled Personnel And Specialists In The Logistics Sector.
                The Laborers Are Under-Skilled, Overworked, And Lack The Necessary Skill Set To Improve The Process's
                Efficiency. Eventually, These Companies Face Issues Such As High Labor Turnover, Increased Training
                Costs, And Underperforming Human Resources.</p>


            <h4>Order Intensity Ratio Is High.</h4>

            <p>Every Logistics Company In India Had To Deal With A Large Number Of Orders That Would Break Their Backs
                In Order To Keep Up With The Supply-Chain Timetable. With So Many Orders Coming In, Keeping Track Of
                What Needs To Be Sent Is Becoming Increasingly Difficult.</p>


            <h4>High Transportation Charges.</h4>

            <p>Transportation Costs Can Account For Up To Half Of A Product's Value. Shippers' Requirements Are Growing.
                There Does Not Appear To Be Enough Money For Everyone To Do It. It Is Unusual For Merchants And
                Manufacturers To Entrust All Of Their Shipping Needs To Just One Or Two Shipping Companies.</p>


            <h4>Shortage Of Drivers And Service Providers.</h4>

            <p>Every Logistics Organization In India Faces The Challenge Of Hiring And Retaining Delivery Personnel. Due
                To A Shortage Of Delivery Personnel, The Workloads Of Multiple Time-Bound Deliveries Are Placed On The
                Current Workers, Leaving Them Burned Out And Discouraged By The Pressure.</p>
            <h2>Challenges Faced By Transporters On The National Highway</h2>
            <h4>Lack Of Accommodation</h4>

            <p>The Nature Of The Job Requires Drivers To Drive For Many Miles Without Falling Asleep Behind The Wheel.
                Due To The Lack Of Sleep And Proper Rest. Accidents Take Place.</p>


            <h4>Pressure To Make Deliveries On Time</h4>

            <p>Distractions While Driving Are A Significant Issue. Truck Drivers Face Far More Stress Than Regular
                Drivers Who Simply Commute From Point A To Point B. They May Cause You To Take Your Eyes And Focus Away
                From The Road, Resulting In An Accident. Researchers Discovered That Distracted Drivers Are Three Times
                More Likely To Be Involved In A Road Accident, Either Causing It Or Failing To Avoid It In Time.</p>


            <h4>Inadequate Truck Maintenance</h4>

            <p>When Office Workers Try To Do Their Jobs, But The Office Computer Won't Start Or Performs Terribly, Their
                Options Are Limited, And The Employer Is To Blame. The Same Is True For Truck Drivers Who Are
                Experiencing Technical Difficulties With Their Vehicles.</p>


            <h4>No Parking Facility</h4>

            <p>Finding A Parking Spot On Busy City Streets Is One Of The Most Difficult Challenges. Imagine How
                Difficult It Is To Park And Fit A 50-Foot Transport Truck In A Tight Parking Spot If You Think An
                Average Vehicle Is Challenging</p>

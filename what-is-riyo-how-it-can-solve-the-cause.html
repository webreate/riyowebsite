          <h2 class="mainHeading">WHAT IS RIYO? HOW IT CAN SOLVE THE CAUSE</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            India's Transport Sector Is Large And Diverse. It Caters To The
            Needs Of Billions Of People In India. Road Transportation Is A Major
            Contributor To The Indian Economy. The Sector Contributes About 5.5
            Percent To The Nation's GDP Alone. The Recent Launch Of India’s
            Logistics Policy Determines The Capabilities Of Transportation
            Sectors, But Still, There Is A Major Gap In Simplifying The
            Logistics Services On National Highways.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To Create An Ecosystem For All Logistics Service Providers Under One
            Roof And Work For The Betterment Of The Logistics Sector On Indian
            Highways, The Revolutionary Idea Of RIYO Was Born. RIYO Seamlessly
            Integrate Technology Into The Highway Network To Resolve All Sorts
            Of Highway And Logistics Problem To Help This Sector On Indian
            Highways.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2 class="subheading">
            To Understand How RIYO Works, You Need To Understand What Are The
            Challenges That India’s Logistic Sector Deals With:
          </h2>
          <br />
          <h2 class="subheading">India’s Logistics Sector</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Today, In India, The Logistics Sector Accounts For Approximately 10%
            Of The Industry. With Their Current Contribution To The Industry,
            Logistics Companies Assist With Product Storage, Packaging, And
            Timely Delivery Right To The Customer's Door. Despite The
            Accomplishments, There Are Still Several Stumbling Blocks And
            Obstacles That Indian Logistics Companies Face.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2 class="subheading">
            Problems Faced By Logistics Companies In India:
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Indian Highway Is A Very Complicated And Vast Network Where
            Logistics Companies Face Lots Of Problems Like:
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />

          <h2>Lack Of Skilled Labour</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Logistics Companies Face A Severe Shortage Of Skilled Personnel And
            Specialists In The Logistics Sector. The Laborers Are Under-Skilled,
            Overworked, And Lack The Necessary Skill Set To Improve The
            Process's Efficiency. Eventually, These Companies Face Issues Such
            As High Labor Turnover, Increased Training Costs, And
            Underperforming Human Resources.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Order Intensity Ratio Is High</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Every Logistics Company In India Had To Deal With A Large Number Of
            Orders That Would Break Their Backs In Order To Keep Up With The
            Supply-Chain Timetable. With So Many Orders Coming In, Keeping Track
            Of What Needs To Be Sent Is Becoming Increasingly Difficult.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>High Transportation Charges</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Transportation Costs Can Account For Up To Half Of A Product's
            Value. Shippers' Requirements Are Growing. There Does Not Appear To
            Be Enough Money For Everyone To Do It. It Is Unusual For Merchants
            And Manufacturers To Entrust All Of Their Shipping Needs To Just One
            Or Two Shipping Companies.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Shortage Of Drivers And Service Providers</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Every Logistics Organization In India Faces The Challenge Of Hiring
            And Retaining Delivery Personnel. Due To A Shortage Of Delivery
            Personnel, The Workloads Of Multiple Time-Bound Deliveries Are
            Placed On The Current Workers, Leaving Them Burned Out And
            Discouraged By The Pressure.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h2 class="mainHeading classCenter">
            Challenges Faced By Transporters On The National Highway
          </h2>
          <br />

          <h2>Lack Of Accommodation</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Nature Of The Job Requires Drivers To Drive For Many Miles
            Without Falling Asleep Behind The Wheel. Due To The Lack Of Sleep
            And Proper Rest. Accidents Take Place.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Pressure To Make Deliveries On Time</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Distractions While Driving Are A Significant Issue. Truck Drivers
            Face Far More Stress Than Regular Drivers Who Simply Commute From
            Point A To Point B. They May Cause You To Take Your Eyes And Focus
            Away From The Road, Resulting In An Accident. Researchers Discovered
            That Distracted Drivers Are Three Times More Likely To Be Involved
            In A Road Accident, Either Causing It Or Failing To Avoid It In
            Time.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Inadequate Truck Maintenance</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            When Office Workers Try To Do Their Jobs, But The Office Computer
            Won't Start Or Performs Terribly, Their Options Are Limited, And The
            Employer Is To Blame. The Same Is True For Truck Drivers Who Are
            Experiencing Technical Difficulties With Their Vehicles.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>No Parking Facility</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Finding A Parking Spot On Busy City Streets Is One Of The Most
            Difficult Challenges. Imagine How Difficult It Is To Park And Fit A
            50-Foot Transport Truck In A Tight Parking Spot If You Think An
            Average Vehicle Is Challenging
          </p>

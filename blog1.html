            <h2>LIFE OF AN INDIAN TRUCK DRIVER</h2>
            <p>More Than 300 Years Ago, A Horse-Drawn Wagon Was Used To Carry Goods From One Place To Another, Which
                Took Months To Reach Its Destination. The Same Trip Today Is Completed In A Maximum Of 6 Days By Big
                Wheels With Trucks Carrying More Goods Than The Horse-Drawn Wagon. As Our Capacity To Move Goods Has
                Grown, So Has Demand. Almost Everything You See, Touch, And Use Today Was Moved By A Truck Driver At
                Some Time In Its Life. It's No Wonder That Many Truck Drivers Love The Phrase, "If You Bought It, A
                Truck Carried It." No One Knows The Truth Of That Phrase Better Than The Hardworking Men And Women Who
                Are Now Driving A Truck.</p>
            <h2>Life Of An Indian Truck Driver</h2>
            <p>The Life Of An Indian Truck Driver Is Not Easy. A Career As A Truck Driver Is Very Different From A
                Career Where You Work In An Office From 9 To 5. Out On The Road As A Truck Driver, You Work For Longer
                Hours, And Your Road Becomes Your Home. A Home Away From Home, Family And Friends. Such A Lifestyle
                Becomes Boring And Lonely. However, You Can Visit Places And Enjoy Adventures On The Roads. But
                According To Studies By The Times Of India, More Than 53% Of Truck Drivers Find Their Jobs
                Dissatisfying. You Know That Truck Drivers Are Essential, But What Is It Like To Be One? A Typical
                Trucker Can Travel 500 Miles Daily Because Most People Work 70 Hours A Week For An Eight-Day Workweek,
                Equating To Nearly 128,000 Miles Per Year.</p>
            <h3>Let’s Dig Deep Into The Problems Faced By An Indian Truck Driver On A Daily Schedule Basis:</h3>
            <img src="image/truck.png" alt="">
            <h3>A Typical Morning:</h3>
            <p>Truck Drivers Generally Wake Up In Their Truck Cabins With No Availability Of Basic Resources Of Washroom
                And Shower Facilities. Thus, They Have To Manage Either Before Getting On The Roads Or Taking A Stop At
                Their Respective Operating Centres Or When They Decide To Refill Their Fuel Tank.</p>
            <h3>A Typical Afternoon</h3>
            <p>After 6-7 Hours Of Driving, They Take A 30-Minute Break In The Midst Of The Day. The Department Of
                Transportation Requires It For The Sake Of Safety. It's Critical For Them To Get Out Of The Vehicle,
                Stretch, And Eat A Light Lunch Or Snack To Remain Fresh And Ready For The Second Portion Of Their
                Driving Day.</p>
            <h3>A Typical Evening</h3>
            <p>Indian Truck Drivers Often Face Challenges In Finding A Place To Park. They Even Had To Carry Their Own
                Food. They Cook Their Food By Themselves And Had To Sleep In Their Truck Cabins. Resulting In Lack Of
                Sleep And Body Aches.</p>

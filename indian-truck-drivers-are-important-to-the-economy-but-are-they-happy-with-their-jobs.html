            INDIAN TRUCK DRIVERS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY. BUT ARE THEY
            HAPPY WITH THEIR JOBS?
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            15% of our Nation’s economy runs on the heartbeat of our Indian
            truck drivers. Yet, they feel apprehensive about their jobs.
            Trucking is vital to the economy of the country. Drivers are in
            charge of delivering 70% of all goods in India. Trucks provide
            medicine, food, raw materials, and other necessities to 80% of our
            communities. Many of us would be unable to receive our needs or go
            about our daily lives without continuous deliveries from trucks
            crossing state and country borders. Major businesses such as
            construction, healthcare, and utilities rely on truck drivers'
            behind-the-scenes activities.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mainHeading classCenter">
            WHY TRUCK DRIVERS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE ECONOMY
          </h2>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>Transport essential goods all over the country:</h3>
          <br />
          <img src="image/motion.png" alt="" width="1080px" />
          <p>
            Truck drivers are responsible for the safety and on-time delivery of
            shipments to our supermarket stores. The oil and gas sectors rely on
            truck drivers to transfer fuel safely. Truck drivers have the
            knowledge and experience to ensure that gasoline reaches customers
            safely.
            <br />
            Drivers also transport medications and medical equipment to
            hospitals. Healthcare providers would be unable to care for patients
            and preserve lives if essential medical items were unavailable.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />

          <h3>Connect Businesses:</h3>
          <br />
          <img
            src="image/business-partners-handshake-global-corporate-with-technology-concept (2).png"
            alt=""
          /><br />
          <p>
            Because of truck drivers' time management and safe driving skills,
            businesses can obtain products from anywhere in the world. They are
            familiar with the best routes and have a system to ensure that the
            supplies exchanged between firms are satisfied, allowing
            partnerships to develop. Companies can focus on the internal labor
            required to expand their operations instead of worrying about
            logistics
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>Help to build Infrastructure:</h3>
          <br />
          <img
            src="image/aerial-view-factory-trucks-parked-near-warehouse-daytime.png"
            alt=""
          /><br />

          <p>
            Truck drivers transport the supplies, materials, and equipment
            required to complete construction projects such as roads, buildings,
            tunnels, and bridges. This vital position promotes community growth
            and, in the event of a natural disaster, aids in the rehabilitation
            of buildings. These infrastructures must also be maintained.
            Delivering lumber, steel, and concrete contributes to the strength
            of foundations and structural integrity.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>Provide help in Emergencies:</h3>
          <br />
          <img src="image/Untitled design.png" alt="" /><br />

          <p>
            Truck deliveries provide emergency supplies to hospitals and first
            responders. That is why Indian Truck drivers are regarded as
            critical on the frontlines, particularly during the peak of the
            COVID-19 outbreak. Many lives would have been lost if they had not
            made regular deliveries on time.
          </p>

          <br />
          <br />
          <h2 class="mainHeading classCenter">
            Why Truck Drivers Are Dissatisfied About Their Job In India
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Unknown to us, they drive around rolling the economy without
            recognition and dignity. After Agriculture, the Sector which has
            generated the maximum employment in India is the Transport Sector.
            Indian Truck drivers play a major role in our transportation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Unusually long working hours, long periods away from home and
            family, and difficult road and driving conditions all emerged as
            issues impacting their health and well-being. Half of the Indian
            truck drivers have trips with over 12 hours, and 46 percent drive
            continuously for over six hours with no break.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            “According to a survey on Indian truck drivers’ status,
            over-speeding was cited as the leading reason for road accidents by
            truckers as of February 2020. Fatigue and sleepiness were cited as
            the second leading cause of road accidents among 38 percent of truck
            drivers in the South Asian country. These types of accidents create
            a huge problem for the drivers and single truck owners both
            financially and mentally.”
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            The truck is indeed their home, sheltering them while on the road.
            They sleep in, under, and even on top of it. Truck drivers spend
            several days on the road and are away from home and family for
            extended periods. At the same time, drivers are usually asked to
            perform 10- to 12-hour shifts to complete deliveries on schedule.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            According to the report by TIMES OF INDIA,the Indian trucking
            industry has around 90 lakh vehicles on the road, which along with
            new additions, need around nine lakh new truck drivers every year.
            Although this number is growing, on the contrary, the number of
            people opting for commercial truck driving as a career or profession
            is dropping rapidly. Consequently, about 40 % of total truck and
            goods transport vehicles remain idle on any given day.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            Truck drivers have a high rate of occupation-related injury and have
            among the highest rates of on-job fatality, yet, for 63% of the
            truck drivers, health does not feature amongst their top three
            priorities in life, as per the survey. <br />
            While the trucking industry plays an integral role in driving the
            growth of India, the stressful and demanding nature of the work done
            by truck drivers impacts their physical and mental well-being.
            Therefore, Truck drivers today are dissatisfied with their jobs.

          <p>
            At RIYO, the salaries of truck drivers depend on the type of truck
            they are driving. After few years of experience, additional
            opportunities may open up. RIYO provides handsome salaries to its
            drivers, worth a fortune.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            Recruitment is a highly competitive part of the trucking industry,
            so you have more control when applying for employment than job
            seekers in other occupations. This is particularly advantageous for
            those seeking a truck driving job without prior experience.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>No Degree Required</h3>

            At RIYO, you can get your commercial driver's license and become a
            truck driver in as little as two weeks.

          />
          <p>
            While working with RIYO, truck drivers have amazing personal
            freedom—no supervisor staring over their shoulders, no office
            politics, and no corporate grind. Your mind can listen to music or
            communicate with friends and family while driving. It's just you,
            your truck, and the open road.
            <br />
            Truck driving can also be flexible, depending on your personal life
            and how much work you want to do. You can plan your routes, whether
            they are lengthy or short, to suit your needs. RIYO drivers enjoy
            the benefits of being their own boss while receiving the back-office
            support of a large carrier.

            Self-driving trucks are on the run. Instead of replacing drivers,
            RIYO will make the work safer and more accessible than ever before
            while preserving a robust demand for drivers who will likely
            continue to play a similar position.

          <p>
            Truck Driving in Inia, which seems to be more of a compulsion than a
            Passion, needs to evolve. RIYO’s initiative is to attract more
            skilled drivers and grant them a smart income, more respect, a
            better social structure, and support from the industry. Truck
            driving may not be the most appealing profession. Still, with good
            benefits, income, and various other benefits offered by RIYO, it can
            be a strong choice for anyone searching for a secure and satisfying
            career as an Indian Truck driver.

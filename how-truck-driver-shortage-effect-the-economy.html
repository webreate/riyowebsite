            HOW TRUCK DRIVER SHORTAGE EFFECT THE ECONOMY
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Indian Truck drivers</strong>  play a major role in maintaining the
            economy of our country. Trucks transport the most 
            economically important commodities. Although these 
            commodities are high on the list of market failures as weak 
            trucking conditions carry the burden associated with their 
            movement is justified from an economical perspective. 
            Truck transportation has profound impacts on the social 
            and economical well being of India. For example, on some 
            of the major expressways, trucks can account for as much 
            as 40% of total traffic on the National Highways. 
            While it is true that package pick-up and delivery activities 
            by Trucks are one of the leading causes of urban 
            delays. There appears to be a huge gap between the 
            transport of goods and the consumption of necessities 
            such as commercial goods, services, and energy. The 
            same can be said for economic contributions such as the 
            nations economic growth. The focus of policy discussions 
            on truck transportation in urban areas is almost always 
            entirely on how to manage the negative impacts of truck 
            activities through restrictions on their movement and 
            access. A long-standing ban on daytime truck delivery in 
            India is one such example.

          <h2 class="mainHeading classCenter">Truck Driver Shortage</h2>
          <br />
          <img src="image/shortage1.png" alt="" width="1080px" />
          <br />
          <p>
            Throughout the last decade, the trucking industry has faced a huge
            driver shortage. The driver shortage affects the entire economy
            because highways transport over 68% of all goods in India. And, as
            the cause that raises driver shortage, it has the potential to have
            a significant impact on the supplier costs and, as a result, It can
            also cause shipping delays and store shortages impacting our
            economy. <br />
            The demographic of the current workforce, particularly age and
            gender, is one of the most significant factors influencing the
            driver shortage. The trucking industry is heavily reliant on male
            employees. With an alarming number of the drivers who are set to
            retire in 10-20 years, we are on the verge of a dangerous cliff. A
            cliff that, if fallen off, will have a significant impact on the
            industry if new, younger workers are not hired.

            Poor Conditions And Low Pay Of Truck Drivers Results In Huge Driver
            Crisis
          </h2>
          <br />
          <img src="image/shortage2.png" alt="" /><br />
          
          <p>
            <strong>
              "Truck drivers are safety devices, " "If the Trucks are running
              behind, you cant just keep the trucker idle. If they are not being
              paid, you cannot back them up for hours. "
            </strong>
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Indian Truck drivers are classified and compensated in such a way
            that they have to wait until they are needed to shipping companies.
            As a result, there is little incentive given to them to use them for
            driving. For now, truckers continue to be misclassified. Truck
            drivers are paid by the load they carry, not by the hour, making
            them some of the most vulnerable workers of the country. they aren’t
            even considered as employees and don’t get any of the benefits or
            protections associated with that status that in itself is a major
            downfall for the truck drivers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            "Truck driving is a fairly difficult profession. It's extremely
            stressful on the body. It requires people to be away from their
            families and awake at extremely odd hours. it becomes lonely for
            them . "However, those who took part did so because there was a wage
            premium or did not have any choice. This has become increasingly a
            result of economic liberalization."
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />

          <h2 class="mainHeading classCenter">Lifestyle of a Truck Driver</h2>
          <br />
          <img src="image/shortage3.png" alt="" /><br />

          <p>
            The lifestyle of a truck driver is the next important topic to
            discuss. This lifestyle is unsuitable for many people, and it
            discourages them from even considering a career as a truck driver.
            Most new drivers are assigned routes that keep them on the road for
            extended periods of time, returning home only a few times per month.
            It can be difficult to adjust to living in a truck and showering at
            rest stops. <br />
            Being on the road nonstop also limits the driver's diet options.
            Nobody can eat fast food and gas station snacks without suffering
            some health consequences. Not to mention, combine that kind of
            eating with a truck driver's healthy life, and the weight will pile
            on. This highcalorie, high-sugar diet can lead to serious health
            issues like diabetes, high blood pressure, and digestive problems.
            <br />
            Drivers frequently skip sleep breaks in order to get their freight
            to its destination as soon as possible. This not only physically but
            also mentally affects the driver. Side effects such as mental
            fogginess, poor judgement, and forgetfulness can all make drivers
            more prone to accidents. <br />

            How RIYO Solves The Truck Driver Shortage
          </h2>
          <br />
          <img src="image/shortage4.png" alt="" /><br />

          <p>
            Due to the challenges regarding the Truck Driver shortage, The
            following are some responses and potential policy solutions that
            RIYO initiates to solve the driver shortage:
          </p>

          <br />
          <br />

          <h2>Smart income to Truck Drivers</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            As we are seeing when there is a shortage of truck drivers, RIYO
            initiative is to raise the wages of its truck drivers with offering
            raises in addition to comprehensive benefits packages and various
            other options for its drivers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Reduce drivers Time on the Road</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Spending more time at home and less time on the road can help
            relieve many of the "lifestyle" issues. Reduce the average length of
            haul and keep our truckers more localized.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Lower Regulated Driving Age</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The 18-20-year-old age group has the highest unemployment rate of
            any age group. RIYO, hires the commercial and deserved truck
            driver's with minimum age to help a large pool of competent workers
            by hiring them through filling open positions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />

          <h2>Independent Trucking</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            With the advanced technology that independent trucking brings, as
            well as the benefits of reducing daily driving stress and boredom,
            RIYO is bound to attract young, tech-savvy drivers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />

          <h2>Giving Less Truckload Shipping</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The majority of the driver shortage occurs on the road (OTR) and
            full-truckload (FTL) shipping methods, as these methods require a
            lot of time on the road and that hard truck driver lifestyle. So
            that the drivers, on the other hand, return home each evening.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />

          <h2 class="mainHeading classCenter">Wrapping Up</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            It is a matter of great concern that the truck drivers who play a
            major role in maintaing the economy of our country are considered as
            a minority and are neglected by the society. Therefore, RIYO,s
            initiative by helping the truck drivers by providing value and
            dignity to their profession so that, the driver on the wheels feel
            proud for their profession and continue to contribute and boost the
            economy of our country. With RIYO, it is possible.
